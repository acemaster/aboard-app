A New Venture to Create A Better Transport Pooling
----------------------------------------------------


**Welcome to my latest and first offical venture the aboard app**

This app is basically a social car pooling app by using node.js as a backend tool.
For now it is only in the Kuwait region and has only four places. I will add more places and extend the region.
This a beta release and of course has a lot of bugs. Check through and let me know what i can do to make it better.


**Requirement**

Any version of android

**USP**

Free, reliable and most of all leads to an environment friendly world. 

**Issues yet to address**
-Have to add more places and cover more area
-Need to include user rating system
-Need to add total list of users giving a ride and how many seats left

As i said its my first commit so lots of support expected :)
